# Task Completion Report

This is the mandatory handoff log for every agent task in PropAI.

## Non-negotiable rule

Before an agent declares a task complete, it must append a report here. This
applies to coding, debugging, UI, data, infrastructure, deployment, and
documentation tasks. A report must be written even when the task is blocked or
the result is a failure.

The report must be honest and specific. Do not describe a partial safeguard as
a complete solution. If live verification was unavailable, say so explicitly.

## Required report format

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short task name

- Requested outcome: What the user asked for.
- Outcome: Complete, partial, blocked, or failed; state what actually happened.
- Changes: Files, migrations, services, or configuration changed.
- Verification: Tests, queries, screenshots, logs, or deployment checks run.
- Deployment/push: Commit SHA, remote push status, and Coolify services needing redeployment.
- Limitations/failures: What remains uncertain, broken, or incomplete.
- Next action: The concrete follow-up, or “None”.
```

## 2026-09-04 — Mandatory completion reporting

- Requested outcome: Create a document that every agent must update after every completed task, with no session allowed to skip it.
- Outcome: Complete in the repository. The rule is now part of the root `AGENTS.md`, and this document provides the required format and first entry.
- Changes: Added hard rule 13 to `AGENTS.md`; created `docs/TASK_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`.
- Verification: Confirmed both files exist and contain the mandatory rule, required fields, and this entry.
- Deployment/push: Pushed to `origin/redesign/propai-product-interface` in commit `7435be51`. No Coolify redeployment is required for this documentation-only change.
- Limitations/failures: Agents must still follow the repository instruction; this file cannot mechanically prevent an agent from ignoring instructions.
- Next action: None.
